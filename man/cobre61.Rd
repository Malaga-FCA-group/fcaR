\title{Data for Differential Diagnosis for Schizophrenia}
\format{
A matrix with 105 rows and 61 columns. Column names are related to different scales for depression and Schizophrenia:
\describe{
\item{COSAS_n}{The \emph{Simpson-Angus Scale}, 7 items to evaluate Parkinsonism-like alterations, related to schizophrenia, in an individual.}
\item{FIPAN_n}{The \emph{Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale}, a set of 29 attributes measuring different aspects and symptoms in schizophrenia.}
\item{FICAL_n}{ The \emph{Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia}, 9 items (attributes) assessing the level of depression in schizophrenia, differentiating between positive and negative aspects of the disease.}
\item{SCIDII_n}{The \emph{Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders}, with 14 variables related to the presence of signs affecting personality.}
\item{dx_ss}{if \code{TRUE}, the diagnosis is strict schizophrenia.}
\item{dx_other}{it \code{TRUE}, the diagnosis is other than schizophrenia, including schizoaffective, bipolar disorder and major depression.}
}

In summary, the dataset consists in the previous 59 attributes related to signs or symptoms, and 2 attributes related to diagnosis (these diagnoses are mutually exclusive, thus only one of them is assigned to each patient). This makes a dataset with 105 objects (patients) and 61 attributes to explore. The symptom attributes are multi-valued.

Thus, according to the specific scales used, all attributes are fuzzy and graded. For a given attribute (symptom), the available grades range from \emph{absent} to \emph{extreme}, with \emph{minimal}, \emph{mild}, \emph{moderate}, \emph{moderate severe} and \emph{severe} in between.

These fuzzy attributes are mapped to values in the interval [0, 1].
