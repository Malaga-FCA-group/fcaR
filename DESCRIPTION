Description: Provides tools to perform fuzzy formal concept
    analysis, presented in Wille (1982) <doi:10.1007/978-3-642-01815-2_23>
    and in Ganter and Obiedkov (2016) <doi:10.1007/978-3-662-49291-8>.  It
    provides functions to load and save a formal context, extract its
    concept lattice and implications.  In addition, one can use the
    implications to compute semantic closures of fuzzy sets and, thus,
    build recommendation systems.
